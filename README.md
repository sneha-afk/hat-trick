# hat-trick

## About

Archive of my final project for AP Computer Science A (2019-20). Development spanned about two weeks in May 2020. 

***Note**: this is a copy of the original repository, as such there is no git history for privacy reasons.*

## Usage

The recommended dependecies for running *Hat Trick* is **Java 8** with the **JavaFX** module. Though I have not tried myself, other Java versions *may* be compatible if JavaFX is available.

*Hat Trick* was built using JDK 1.8.0_333 which can be found in the official [Oracle archives](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html) on the Eclipse IDE. 

To start the program:
1. Ensure Java 8 and JavaFX are properly configured in an IDE of your choice.
2. Run the program.^

## Design Process
See [`design_doc.md`](design_doc.md) for the original brainstorm of the project.
